# Climate-Change-Sentiment-Predictor
This project aims to develop a program that, given a tweet relating to climate change, can predict whether the user's sentiment is sympathetic regarding climate change or not. Using data from a dataset of tweets with a manually labeled sentiment to train from, we aim to help future analysis regarding climate change through this program that looks into human sentiments through tweets. By providing a program that automatically labels sentiments, this project can easily provide future research with numerous and timely data to use.
