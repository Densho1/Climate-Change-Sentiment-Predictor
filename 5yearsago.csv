jbo KeanMP where are those windmills being made again Financial incentive to MANIPULATE the world much a bit old but still relevant I bet according to in between tantrums the steady breathing of volcanoes quietly sheds upwards of a quarter of a billion tons of CO2 every year Related some science to go with that volcanos spew more greenhouse gasses and CFCs into the atmosphere than humans can make Think about it where did the earth get its atmosphere again Hint VOLCANOS oh and because it s hot enough it goes to where ozone is Similarly cooler ocean has more CO2 in it Further warmer ocean temps dissolve carbonates that precipitate out Underwater volcanos make this MOST obvious and atm CO2 levels near one are bound to be greatly elevated Soda holds more CO2 when it is cold and releases it goes flat as it warms up When Coca Cola designed their famous glass the ice floats at the top where cold blocks loss of CO2 Then a straw gets un watered down bubbly soda until the glass is empty
If you believe humans cause climate change and you are human well I guess you are part of the problem well kinda you are I think describing the effect of an equilibrium reaction though the boiling pot absorbing latent heat of vaporization to make steam is not a bad analogy Cross threshold depleting forces take over
who are these experts and why is my common sense inferior to their B S pseudo science I predict overall cooling until 2040 at which point the 70 year cycle in N hemisphere causes it to rise again Let s see who is right
2022 so called greenhouse gasses like CO2 have a minimal effect At equilibrium the relative levels depend on temperature FYI depleted by rain eaten by plants and algae and poor IR absorption for temps found on earth Unlike water the other G H gas
